                        I am a dedicated Software Developer with over three years of experience in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and data integration.
                        My expertise spans Java, Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, SQL, and DevOps automation, allowing me to design and deploy scalable solutions.
                        With a strong foundation in database management, backend development, and cloud computing, I have successfully built API-driven applications, automated CI/CD pipelines, and containerized microservices with Kubernetes and Docker.
                        My ability to optimize ETL workflows and enhance system interoperability has improved efficiency and performance in various projects.
